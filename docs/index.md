# Overview

This site is used to keep notes on things I have learned for writing code, documentation, and signing code. It also is used to test out some of the features for documentation purpose. I am not really looking for pull requests but if you notice something that is false or could be a security issue, please open an issue and create a pull requests. Just ensure you're able to explain the issue fully and have references that can back it up.

Hopefully, you can learn something from this page as well.
